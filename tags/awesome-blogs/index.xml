      <description>I found a great post at danluu.com. I strongly recommend it! The author explores player interactions from male and female perspectives. What I found captivating is the methodical, data-driven, scientific way he presented his findings. More of this please! His other posts are great too, and cover a wide variety of topics.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been devouring his posts, and it&amp;rsquo;s all kinds of fascinating. It&amp;rsquo;s rare to find a blog so good, so I decided to write an endorsement post.</description>
