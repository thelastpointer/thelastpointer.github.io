      <description>Another awesome blog!
Check this: out https://www.filfre.net/ Jimmy Maher writes about early video games in an exquisitely detailed, yet interesting manner.
I found it while doing some research on Ultima Underworld; his explanation of the unique mechanics in the game immediately caught my attention: simple, attentive, and almost entirely devoid of usual game critic cliches. Among other super interesting things I loved his coverage on the Ultima series, the history of early British video games, and his outstandingly coherent depiction of early technology.</description>

      <description>I found a great post at danluu.com. I strongly recommend it! The author explores player interactions from male and female perspectives. What I found captivating is the methodical, data-driven, scientific way he presented his findings. More of this please! His other posts are great too, and cover a wide variety of topics.
Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been devouring his posts, and it&amp;rsquo;s all kinds of fascinating. It&amp;rsquo;s rare to find a blog so good, so I decided to write an endorsement post.</description>
