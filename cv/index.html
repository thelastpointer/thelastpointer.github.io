<h2 id="lead-programmer--elder-brain-studios--2015-">Lead Programmer / Elder Brain Studios / 2015-</h2>
<p>I took on a lot of responsibility by joining Elder Brains to build a whole game. I also took part in a whole lot of work for the company&rsquo;s other efforts &ndash; creating mobile ports (Android and iOS) for an existing project and creating a build server which handles multiple platforms and projects. Best part: working with a lot of talented artists!</p>

<h2 id="lead-programmer--360world--2013-2015">Lead Programmer / 360World / 2013-2015</h2>
<p>This was an adventure for sure &ndash; an ambitious startup focused on creating a head mounted display from scratch. I worked with cutting-edge technology, often unreleased prototypes by various companies from all over the world. I met a lot of interesting people, including athletes like Jeb Corliss and Yves Rossi (and built HMD&rsquo;s for them).</p>
<p>I worked very closely with hardware; the programs I&rsquo;ve written often had to run on hardware which was just being soldered together on a table next to me. My prototyping skills were maxed out; once I had to build a new feature in 20 minutes &ndash; between two helicopter takeoffs. Gnarly!</p>

<h2 id="lead-programmer--pixelsky-games--2012-2013">Lead Programmer / Pixelsky Games / 2012-2013</h2>
<p>I was responsible for the technical parts of developing a medium-sized indie game, training a team for the Unity engine and supporting them when needed. Rapid prototyping skills, ability to work unsupervised and good communication and team management skills were a must for this job. I made very good friends here.</p>
<p>This was the first time I had to lead a team. I made quite a few prototypes and tools, basically making everyone else&rsquo;s work as streamlined as possible.</p>
<h3 id="error-threshold">Error Threshold</h3>
<p>An assymetric multiplayer third-person-shooter. The project was showcased privately at GDC in 2012. It went through a lot of iterations in just one year; the end result was promising, but it was ultimately canned.</p>

<p>Gameplay and system programming, including network programming for a MMO game, AI coding, multiple gameplay prototypes and finalizing ideas. I got my first two years experience with the Unity engine here. We had British clients with a QA team from Poland, so I was able to perfect my communication skills here.</p>
<h3 id="pora-ora">Pora Ora</h3>
<p>The first &ldquo;big&rdquo; game I worked on &ndash; an educational MMO for kids, intended to be used in British schools as a tool to make learning more interesting.</p>

<p>I only worked briefly on this project, and last I heard all my code was replaced, but I&rsquo;m still quite proud of it because a lot of my friends absolutely loved it :)</p>

<h2 id="previous-works--education">Previous works &amp; Education</h2>
<p>My junior years, while formative, are less interesting: I worked as a web developer (PHP, HTML, CSS, JS, and all the other buzzwords that were popular before Ruby) and on a large medical application that had a legacy C++ codebase. C++ used to be my language of choice before I switched to C#. I sometimes miss the preprocessor.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been professionally active since 2008. I studied computer science but never got a degree.</p>
